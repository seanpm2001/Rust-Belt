// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Rust-Belt
// About:
// I decided to make Rust the main project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Rust-Belt) as this project is solely about projects written in the Rust programming language. Rust is being used, as it fits here. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
